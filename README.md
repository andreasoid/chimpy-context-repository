# Chimpy Context Repository

This repository is the **single source of truth** for how the company thinks, decides, and acts.

If something is not written here, it is **not a rule, not strategy, and not a commitment**.

## What's inside

- `company_context_repository_blueprint.md`: Blueprint for what this repository contains and how it is maintained.
- `constitution.md`: Highest-level identity and decision foundations.
- `governance.md`: Decision rights and escalation rules.

## Suggested structure (from the blueprint)

Over time, this repo typically grows into a structure like:

```
/context
  constitution.md
  governance.md
  vision.md
  mission.md
  principles.md
  rules.md
  target_audience.md
  strategy_now.md
  strategy_next.md
  strategy_later.md
  roadmap.md
  prd_template.md
  prds/
  rfcs/
  archive/
```

## Notes on GitHub naming

GitHub repository **names cannot contain spaces**, so the GitHub repo will need a slug such as:

- `chimpy-context-repository` (recommended)
- `Chimpy-Context-Repository`

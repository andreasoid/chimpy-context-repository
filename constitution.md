# Constitution

## Purpose
This constitution defines the **identity, boundaries, and decision foundations** of the company.

It exists to:
- Protect what must remain stable
- Clarify ultimate authority
- Prevent silent drift of values, purpose, and power

This document changes **rarely and deliberately**.

---

## Supremacy

This constitution is the **highest-level document** of the company.

In case of conflict, precedence is:
1. `constitution.md`
2. `governance.md`
3. `company_context_repository_blueprint.md`
4. All other documents

No lower-level document may override this constitution.

---

## Purpose

The company exists to:
- Solve a real problem for real customers
- Create long-term value, not short-term optimization
- Act responsibly toward customers, employees, and partners

The exact mission and vision are defined in `mission.md` and `vision.md`.

---

## Non-Negotiables

The company will:
- Act legally and ethically
- Document decisions that affect others
- Respect defined decision rights
- Prefer clarity over ambiguity

The company will not:
- Sacrifice long-term trust for short-term gain
- Allow undocumented power or shadow governance
- Operate on unwritten rules

---

## Decision Authority

Decision rights are explicitly defined in `governance.md`.

Key principles:
- Every decision has one owner
- Escalation is expected when boundaries are crossed
- Disagreements are resolved by authority, not consensus

No role may assume authority not granted in `governance.md`.

---

## Company Context

The company maintains a written, versioned context repository as defined in `company_context_repository_blueprint.md`.

Rules:
- Written context is authoritative
- Unwritten rules are invalid
- Deprecated context is archived, not deleted

This repository is mandatory input for company decisions.

---

## Change Rule

Changes to this constitution:
- Require **supermajority approval** as defined in `governance.md`
- Must be documented with clear rationale
- Are reviewed at most once per year

---

## Final Rule

When in doubt:
- Follow this constitution
- Escalate according to governance
- Write down the outcome
- Execute

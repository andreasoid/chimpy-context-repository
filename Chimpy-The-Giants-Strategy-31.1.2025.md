# *THE GIANTS STRATEGY.*

## *Peace of Mind for 100 Million Europeans.*

Whether our customers actively use our powerbanks or are simply reassured by their availability: Chimpy is peace of mind for people on the go. Our aspiration is to provide this feeling to 100 million Europeans over the next five years.

## *Chasing giants to scale fast and efficiently.*

For our customers, the best powerbank is the one available. That’s why we’ve made the strategic choice to focus on partnering with Giants, chains of convenience retail across Europe that operate anytime-anywhere brands like k kiosk, 7-Eleven, and Relay.

By focusing our resources on this effort, we will accelerate our growth through shorter sales cycles and faster user adoption by tapping into the established customer bases at high-traffic locations. At the same time, we will increase our efficiency by only investing directly in country markets after we have established a successful Giant partnership and by driving down unit costs to reach the industry margin benchmark. By scaling fast and efficiently, we address Chimpy’s most pressing strategic challenges to thrive long term in an increasingly competitive environment and reduce dependency on specific markets or suppliers.

## *Chimpy leads with its best-in-class SERVICE and cost leadership.*

Powerbank rental is a must-have service and Chimpy’s solution is built for convenience retail. We focus on giving our customers an experience they want to come back for, over and over again. Our unique off-the-shelf formula makes renting a powerbank no different than buying a coffee to go and our no-stress return policy removes all pressure. Like this, we help shops to turn casual customers into loyal fans.

The successful execution of this strategy relies on *three core capabilities*: Giant Acquisition: High-level deal-making through expertise in sales, relationship management, B2B marketing, and M\&A to secure and maintain strategic partnerships with Giants; Product Development: Developing our powerbank platform to advance it and merge current advantages with the state-of-the-art feature level; Operational Excellence: Delivering a 1A service to customers and partners with cost discipline and optimized processes to increase profitability in a high-volume, low-margin business. 

We will keep track of our advancement by measuring us against following milestones:

* By 2025, launch one new Giant partnership from scratch  
* By 2027, deliver 80% of rentals at \< 0.20 chf total variable costs (refurbishment, logistics)  
* By 2029, make our service available to 100 million Europeans

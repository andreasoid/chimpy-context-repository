# Governance

## Purpose
This document defines **who decides what**, **how decisions are made**, and **which decisions are hard to change**. Its goal is clarity, speed, and accountability.

If a decision is not covered here, it must be escalated.

---

## Decision Layers

The company operates with four clear decision layers:

1. **Owner / Board** – existence and identity of the company
2. **CEO** – direction and accountability
3. **Management** – execution of strategy
4. **Teams / Individuals** – day-to-day work

Each layer has exclusive authority over specific decisions.

---

## Supermajority

A **supermajority** means **at least two-thirds (⅔)** approval of all eligible voters.

Examples:
- 3 voters → 2 approvals required
- 5 voters → 4 approvals required

Supermajority is used only for decisions that must be **hard to change**.
